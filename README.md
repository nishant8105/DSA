# 📘 Daily DSA Journey (Python)

This repository documents my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey in Python**, following a **1-hour daily discipline**.  
The goal is to build **strong problem-solving skills**, write **clean Python code**, and prepare for **coding interviews**.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Master core **DSA concepts**
- Solve problems **daily with consistency**
- Improve **logical thinking & optimization**
- Be interview-ready for product-based companies

---

## ⏰ Daily Commitment
**🕒 1 Hour / Day**
- **15 min** – Learn / revise concepts
- **35 min** – Solve 2 DSA problems
- **10 min** – Review & notes

Consistency > speed.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 🐍
- **Editor:** VS Code
- **Practice Platforms:** LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks
---

## 📅 Study Roadmap (1 Hour / Day)

### 🟢 Phase 1: Basics
- Time & Space Complexity
- Arrays
- Strings
- Recursion

### 🔵 Phase 2: Core Data Structures
- Searching & Sorting
- Hashing
- Stack & Queue
- Linked List

### 🟣 Phase 3: Advanced Topics
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

---

## 📌 Daily Rules
- Solve problems **without looking at solutions first**
- Always analyze **time & space complexity**
- Maintain a **mistake notebook**
- Revise weekly
- Push code daily (even small progress)

---

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Approach
1. Understand the problem
2. Write brute force solution
3. Optimize
4. Implement in Python
5. Analyze complexity

## 📈 Progress Tracker

| Day | Topic | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| Day 1 | Time & Space Complexity | ✅ |
| Day 2 | Arrays Basics | ⏳ |
| Day 3 | Strings | ⏳ |

---

## 🚀 Motivation
> “Consistency beats talent when talent doesn’t practice consistently.”

This repository is a **proof of discipline**, not perfection.

---

## 📬 Future Plans
- Add optimized solutions
- Add interview notes
- Add pattern-wise problem lists
- Convert notes into a revision guide
